We fitted different time series models and ensemble techniques to predict cloud resource usage for successive hours. Different time series analysis techniques were implemented to study the dataset and to choose the appropriate model. Various cloud resources such as CPU usage, disk read times, disk write times and memory usage are predicted using the above models.
